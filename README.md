# TeachYourselfCS
Following the curriculum from https://teachyourselfcs.com/


Programming //	Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion. //	Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs	Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A//

Computer Architecture //	If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.//	Computer Organization and Design	//Berkeley CS 61C//

Algorithms and Data Structures	//If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve hard problems.//	The Algorithm Design Manual//	Steven Skiena’s lectures //

Math for CS	//CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.	//Mathematics for Computer Science	//Tom Leighton’s MIT 6.042J//

Operating Systems	//Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.	//Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces	//Berkeley CS 162//

Computer Networking//	The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential. //	Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach	//Stanford CS 144

Databases//	Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work. //	Readings in Database Systems//	Joe Hellerstein’s Berkeley CS 186

Languages and Compilers	//If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily.	//Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools //	Alex Aiken’s course on Lagunita

Distributed Systems	//These days, most systems are distributed systems.	//Distributed Systems, 3rd Edition by Maarten van Steen	//🤷‍
